# Airport

The nearest airport is San Diego International Airport **(SAN)**. The airport is right in downtown San Diego and La Jolla is about 20 minutes north.

# Getting around San Diego

Especially if you would like to explore San Diego, we recommend bringing or renting a car. San Diego is quite hilly, highway-y and does not yet have good public transit, walking or biking options. If this does not work for you, you might consider staying in La Jolla, which is somewhat more walkeable neighborhood. Lyft is reasonably priced if you just need a couple short rides around town.
