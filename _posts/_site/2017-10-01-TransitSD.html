<h1 id="getting-around-san-diego">Getting around San Diego</h1>

<p>San Diego is a great city with many interesting neighborhoods and tons of fun things to do. We recommend bringing or renting a car, particularly if you are wanting to go exploring or go do things. San Diego is quite hilly, highway-y and does not yet have good public transit, walking, or biking options. If you would rather not rent or bring a car, you might consider staying in La Jolla, which is somewhat more walkable neighborhood and is where the ceremony and reception will be. <a href="https://www.lyft.com/invite/ISABELA13526">Lyft</a> is reasonably priced if you just need a couple short rides around town.</p>
