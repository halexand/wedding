# Airport

The nearest airport is San Diego International Airport **(SAN)**. The airport is located in downtown San Diego. The ceremony and other activities will take place in and around La Jolla, which is about 20 minutes north.

# Getting around San Diego

San Diego is a great city with many interesting neighborhoods and tons of fun things to do. We recommend bringing or renting a car, particularly if you are wanting to go exploring or go do things. San Diego is quite hilly, highway-y and does not yet have good public transit, walking, or biking options. If you would rather not rent or bring a car, you might consider staying in La Jolla, which is somewhat more walkeable neighborhood and is where the ceremony and reception will be. [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/invite/ISABELA13526) is reasonably priced if you just need a couple short rides around town.
