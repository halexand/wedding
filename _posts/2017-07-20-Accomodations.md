We recommend reserving accommodation as soon as possible as June is the start of the tourist season in San Diego! [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/) is a good option, especially for groups. Here are some traditional hotel options if you prefer:

#### Hotels

* [La Jolla Shores Hotel](http://www.ljshoreshotel.com/) is a classic hotel just down the beach from the wedding location.

* [The Residence Inn by Marriot](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lajca-residence-inn-san-diego-la-jolla/) in La Jolla is also conveniently located and more affordable.
