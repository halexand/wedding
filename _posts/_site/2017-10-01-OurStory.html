<p>Harriet and Isabela disagree over when their first date was.</p>

<p>Harriet is positive that it was after a wonderful Thanksgiving friends dinner, when they decided to go on a bike ride together. It was a blisteringly cold November day, and numb fingers and frozen noses did not stop them from spending time together.</p>

<p>Izi thinks it was an Indian dinner she cooked for Harriet after kicking her housemates out. (She still cannot believe she did that.)</p>

<p>Some might argue that it was when Isabela taught Harriet to windsurf that she really won her heart, or that Harrietâ€™s popovers sealed the deal. Regardless, they quickly discovered they shared a love of cooking, morning chess, the outdoors and, of course, the ocean.</p>

<p>Now, 4 years later they are excited to cement their relationship and celebrate with you in California!</p>
