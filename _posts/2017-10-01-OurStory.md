Harriet and Isabela argue over when their first date was.

Harriet is positive that it was after a wonderful Thanksgiving friends dinner, when they decided to go on a bike ride together. It was a blisteringly cold November day, and numb fingers and frozen noses did not stop them from spending time together.

Izi thinks it was an Indian dinner she cooked for Harriet after kicking her housemates out. (She still cannot believe she did that).

Some might argue that it was when Isabela taught Harriet to windsurf that she lreally won her heart, or that Harriet's popovers sealed the deal. Regardless, they quickly discovered they shared a love of cooking, morning chess, the outdoors and, of course, the ocean.

Now, 4 years later we are excited to cement our relationship and celebrate with you in California!
