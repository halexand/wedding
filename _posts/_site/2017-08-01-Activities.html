<p>Here are some fun activities in the San Diego area if you have some time to spare</p>

<h1 id="beaches">Beaches</h1>

<p>There are beautiful public beaches all along the coast in San Diego! This is by far our favorite San Diego activity. We have been learning how to surf near La Jolla Shores. There are more secluded beaches near Torrey Pines state park, which also offers hiking trails. Ocean Beach is further south and has a fun boardwalk.</p>

<h1 id="la-jolla-cove">La Jolla cove</h1>

<p>La Jolla cove is a nice spot to walk around, view sea lions and birds. You can also snorkel and kayak in the cove and its caves (with a guided tour).</p>
