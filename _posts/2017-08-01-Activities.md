Here are some fun activities in the San Diego area if you have some time to spare

# Beaches

There are beautiful public beaches all along the coast in San Diego! This is by far our favorite San Diego activity. We have been learning how to surf near La Jolla Shores. There are more secluded beaches near Torrey Pines state park, which also offers hiking trails. Ocean Beach is further south and has a fun boardwalk.

# La Jolla cove

La Jolla cove is a nice spot to walk around, view sea lions and birds. You can also snorkel and kayak in the cove and its caves (with a guided tour).


# Breweries

San Diego is home to many breweries, such as "The Green Flash" and "Stone". India St offers many small brew-pubs.

# Attractions

* The world-famous San Diego zoo, as seen in the hit film, *Madagascar*, is in San Diego!

* Balboa Park is a beautiful mission style park with museums and cultural events on offer.

# Nearby

* Baja California, Mexico is just south of San Diego. We recommend visiting Ensenada and the nearby "Valle de Guadaloupe" if you have a chance.

* Los Angeles is 2 hours north of San Diego.
